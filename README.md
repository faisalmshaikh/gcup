Google Contacts Uploader (gcup)
====

**gcup** is a Python script that bulk uploads vCards (.vcf files) stored in a directory to your Google Contacts.
This is a very minimal script that works with Basic Authentication.

**Because of this reason, if you use this script without following the steps below, you will get a *"Password Incorrect"* error.**

This issue will be resolved in future updates but for now, you can upload to Google Contacts via basic authentication by allowing
less secure apps to access you account, as described [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en).
